## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, where my research focuses on pioneering AI-driven breakthroughs in fundamental science. With a background in theoretical physics, my work applying AI across diverse scientific datasets—from particle physics and gravitational waves to natural language—has cultivated a deep intuition for the complexity and scaling of different modalities and how machine learning models can leverage them.

My recent research includes developing **PolarBERT**, the first foundation model for Antarctic neutrino telescope data, and training impactful sample-efficient **large language models** (like BabyLlama, a top performer in the BabyLM challenge). I am passionate about pushing the limits of our understanding of the natural world by developing and applying advanced AI.

## Research Experience

**Assistant Professor** (Jan 2025 – Present)  
*Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen*
- Leading development of foundational models for science, leveraging multi-modal approaches with large-scale datasets (e.g., 65 TB from LHC, medical wearables).
- Supervising research on advanced LLM techniques, including RL for attention pattern analysis in verifiable domains.

**Senior Postdoctoral Researcher** (Aug 2021 – Dec 2024)  
*Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen*
- Pioneered **PolarBERT**, the first transformer-based foundation model for Antarctic IceCube neutrino data, achieving excellent sample efficiency.
- Developed **BabyLlama**, the top-performing decoder-only LLM (leveraging self-distillation) in the 2023 BabyLM challenge; adopted as the 2024 official baseline.
- Led teams to Gold & Silver medals in science-focused Kaggle competitions (G2Net Gravitational Waves, IceCube Neutrinos).

**Visiting Researcher** (Jun 2016 – Present)  
*CERN, Switzerland*
- Active member of the SHiP international collaboration; developed advanced quantum Monte Carlo simulations for new particle discovery potential (Majorana particles).

**Postdoctoral Researcher** (Jun 2016 – Jul 2021)  
*École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland*
- Spearheaded a large-scale, computationally intensive project on the origin of matter in the Universe.
- Pioneered methods to transform complex quantum field theory problems into computable models, leading to top-tier publications.
- Taught Master's courses (Group Theory, Classical Field Theory) and supervised 8 Master's students.
